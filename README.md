# C-projects
These are homework assignments done by me during the course "Introduction to Systems Programming" ("Matam");

Every assignment is in its own directory, and has its own README file, (usually) containing a compilation
command with all necessary files. The original assignment instructions are included as well.

All assignments need to be compiled by the GNU compiler (GCC) and run in a UNIX-based environment.
